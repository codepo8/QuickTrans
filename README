QuickTrans is a translation widget using the W3C widgets spec: http://www.w3.org/TR/widgets-apis/ and using the Vodafone widget SDK http://www.betavine.net/bvportal/resources/widgets/research

If you want to try it out, you need Opera installed and simply click on the .wgt file in the dist folder.

The widget uses YQL and the Google Translation API http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxlanguage/documentation/#Translate 

Enjoy
